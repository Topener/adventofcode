# Advent of Code

Hi all!

My AdventOfCode is `node.js` based. 

To run any day, type `node index.js <day#>` and it will execute the day you inputted. Make sure you fill the relevant `input.txt` file with the input for that day if you want to see your own code.

To run code using sample code, type `node index.js <day#> sample` and it will execute the day you inputted with the sample input. In case of 2 different sample inputs, like day 1, it will automatically find sample2.txt for part 2.

The current main branch is 2023, but code from previous years is also available.

In any solution you can replace my input.txt with your content and see if it works for yours as well.

I am always curious to better solutions, so feel free to PR on an existing day any improvements to the code. As long as they're actually improvements, not just for the sake of shorter. My code should be production-deployable (in my mind) so they should be easily readable.

For this purpose, also read [my article about 1-liners](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/we-need-to-talk-about-the-one-liners-58f460c05fc5?source=friends_link&sk=102a7a363db7988174bfb87666f63ecb). I would say I prefer longer code as long as it is readable. If something can be faster, then of course it should be.

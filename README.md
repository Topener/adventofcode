# adventofcode2020

Hi all!

My AdventOfCode is node.js based. Step into each day folder and run `node program.js` to run it.

Replace my input.txt with your content and see if it works for yours as well.

I am always curious to better solutions, so feel free to PR on an existing day any improvements to the code. As long as they're actually improvements, not just for the sake of shorter. My code should be production-deployable (in my mind) so they should be easily readable.

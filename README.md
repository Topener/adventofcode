# Advent of Code

Hi all!

My AdventOfCode is `node.js` based. 

To run any day, type `node index.js <day#>` and it will execute the day you inputted. Make sure you fill the relevant `input.txt` file with the input for that day if you want to see your own code.

The current main branch is 2021, but my code from last year is also available in branch 2020. I didn't get further than day 10 yet though. 


For 2020: Step into each day folder and run `node program.js` to run it. 

In any solution you can replace my input.txt with your content and see if it works for yours as well.

I am always curious to better solutions, so feel free to PR on an existing day any improvements to the code. As long as they're actually improvements, not just for the sake of shorter. My code should be production-deployable (in my mind) so they should be easily readable.

For this purpose, also read [my article about 1-liners](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/we-need-to-talk-about-the-one-liners-58f460c05fc5?source=friends_link&sk=102a7a363db7988174bfb87666f63ecb). I would say I prefer longer code as long as it is readable. If something can be faster, then of course it should be.
